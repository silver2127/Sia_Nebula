 basic_ship_hull_downgrade:0 "Tier I Surface Hull Downgrade"
 basic_ship_hull_downgrade_desc:0 "Time to pick upthe pace!  Production speed is increased by reducing fuel capacity.  This offers the benifit of increased speed at the cost of range.  The faster pace of production will have some impact on reliability.  \n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§!, §YHeavy Ships§! or §YCarriers§! reduces §Yproduction cost§! and increases the vessal's §Yspeed§!, but at a cost to §Yrange§! and §Yreliability§!." 
 improved_ship_hull_downgrade:0 "Tier II Surface Hull Downgrade"
 improved_ship_hull_downgrade_desc:0 "Seafaring vessals are urgently needed!  Production speed futher increased by halfing the ship's fuel capacity and cutting corners on inspections.  The significant decrease in fuel availability will decrease Carrier vessals aircraft capacity.  \n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§!, §YHeavy Ships§! or §YCarriers§! increases the vessal's §Yspeed§!, but at great cost to §Yrange§! and §Yreliability§!."
 advanced_ship_hull_downgrade:0 "Tier III Surface Hull Downgrade"
 advanced_ship_hull_downgrade_desc:0 "Times are desperate and we need ships NOW!  Production speed is vastly accelerated by eliminating bulkheads to reduce vessals to bare bones.  This extreme approach to cost savings guarantees quicker ship production, but not their sea-worthiness!  \n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§!, §YHeavy Ships§! or §YCarriers§! increases the vessal's §Yspeed§!, but reduces its §Yrange§!, §Yreliability§! and ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!."
 basic_submarine_hull_downgrade:0 "Tier I Submarine Hull Downgrade"
 basic_submarine_hull_downgrade_desc:0 "Time to pick upthe pace!  Production speed is increased by reducing fuel capacity.  This offers the benifit of increased speed at the cost of range.  The faster pace of production will have some impact on reliability.  \n\nMounting this module on §YSbmarines§! reduces §Yproduction cost§! and increases the vessal's §Yspeed§!, but at a cost to §Yrange§! and §Yreliability§!." 
 improved_submarine_hull_downgrade:0 "Tier II Submarine Hull Downgrade"
 improved_submarine_hull_downgrade_desc:0 "Submarines are urgently needed!  Production speed futher increased by halfing the ship's fuel capacity and cutting corners on inspections.  It takes a brave man to hug the ocean floor in one of these tin cans!  \n\nMounting this module on §YSubmarines increases the vessal's §Yspeed§!, but at great cost to §Yrange§! and §Yreliability§!."
 basic_silent_submarine:0 "Silent Submarine"
 basic_silent_submarine_desc:0 "Rubber tiles containing thousands of tiny voids, applied to the outer hulls of submarines to absorb the sound waves of active sonar and attenuate the sounds emitted from the vessel.  \n\nMounting this module on §YSubmarines§! reduces §Ysub visability§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 improved_silent_submarine:0 "Improved Silent Submarine"
 improved_silent_submarine_desc:0 "Advances in the Anechoic tile design, engine dampner's and adhesive improves hydrodynamics while significantly reducing reflectivity to sonar waves.  \n\nMounting this module on §YSubmarines§! reduces §Ysub visability§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 silent_torpedo:0 "Silent Torpedo"
 silent_torpedo_desc:0 "Improvements in low-wake fin and propeller design allows torpedo to run invisible until it impacts on target."
 latewar_ship_torpedo_launcher:0 "Late War Ship Torpedo Launcher"
 latewar_ship_torpedo_launcher_desc:1 "Wire guided technology greatly improves accurcary.\n\nMounting this module on §YLight Ships§! or §YCruisers§! allows them to do massive damage to enemy §YCapital Ships§!."
 advanced_submarine_snorkel:0 "Advanced Submarine Snorkel"
 advanced_submarine_snorkel_desc:1 "A perfected design that nearly eliminates noise and surface vibration.  New coating absorbs radar energy eliminating the probability of being detected on radar.\n\nMounting this module on §YSubmarines§! greatly reduces their §YVisibility§!, making them nearly invisible."
 advanced_submarine_snorkel_radar:0 "Radar Equipped Snorkel"
 advanced_submarine_snorkel_radar_desc:1 "A compact radar mounted onto a submarine snorkel tower for improved detection ranges and attack capabilities.  Some comprimises had to made in the merging of these two technologies.  \n\nMounting this module on §YSubmarines§! reduces their §YVisibility§! while increasing their §Ysurface detection§! and §Ysub detection§! abilites."
 op_secondary_battery:0 "Dual-Purpose, High-Velocity Secondary Battery"
 op_secondary_battery_desc:1 "High-Velocity anti-ship and anti-air guns in a single mount allows for more flexibility while providing devastating firepower and saving weight.\n\nMounting a §YSecondary Battery§! Module gives a §YCruiser§!, §YCarrier§!, §Ysubmarine§!, or §YHeavy Ship§! a good amount of §YLight Gun Attack§! and allows it to engage a second target. This module also increases §YAnti-Air Attack§!."
 basic_secondary_shell:0 "Small-Caliber, multipurpose, Semi-Armor Piercing Shell"
 basic_secondary_shell_desc:0 "A compromise between armor-piercing performance and explosive power in a small package, this small shell does significantly more damage after punching through the weak armor of light ships and can be fuzed for air-burst against aircraft."
 improved_secondary_shell:0 "Improved Secondary Multipurpose, Semi-Armor Piercing Shell"
 improved_secondary_shell_desc:0 "An armor-piercing shell for secondary, small caliber guns gives seconadry mounts a bigger say in a battle's outcome."
