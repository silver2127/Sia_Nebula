 dynamic_wp_config.d:0 "Hello, fellow user of my mod!\n"Make Peace, Not War" is an attempt to bring conditional surrender to Hearts of Iron within the possibilities of modding. As such, be warned that bugs and other errors may happen and interrupt your gaming experience. If you encounter any, please be so kind and report them to the workshop page under "Bugs". Thank you!\nDue to the thousands of possibilities to end wars and due to the limitations of the "whitepeace" command, it's not always possible to cover every war scenario. To ensure a bugless playthrough you should aim to keep the wars as simple as possible. Make sure to read the mod description for further information.\n"Make Peace, Not War" also allows you to enable two options. If you allow the AI to ask for peace, they may send an event to you upon losing badly. You will still have the option to decline this and force your own peace though.\nThe second option can cause minor nations to face a coup or even a revolution after a defeat in a recent war. The chances are random each time and if a nation is lucky, nothing will change.\nNow, please select the options you want to have for this playthrough. It's not possible to change them mid-game."

 swp_fl.2.t:0 "One of our Members wants to sign a Peace!"
 swp_fl.2.d:0 "Do we accept? The war will then end for everyone in our faction, including us!"

 ##GOVERNMENT STUFF##
 #democracy coup
 swp_government.2.t:0 "Democrats are demanding our resignation!"
 swp_government.2.d:0 "After the recent defeat against one of our neighbors, several people, mostly students and intellectuals, are protesting against our regime. They are not only demanding liberal changes or other democratic ideals, but want to replace us with representatives from the people! Our year-long reign would then end and if we don't destroy several documents, we may be charged with crimes against our people and get executed!\n Do we let this happen, destroy any evidence that burden us and flee the country? Or would it be better to continue the arrest and execution of those people voicing their minds?\nLatter solution may lead to an uprising or even a civil war..."
 swp_government.2.a:0 "We'll board the next plane."
 swp_government.2.b:0 "Arrest those liberals."
 #fascism coup
 swp_government.3.t:0 "Nationalism threatens our country!"
 swp_government.3.d:0 "Several nationalist thoughts have emerged in the last weeks since our defeat in a war with one of our neighbors. After we lost some territory and were forced to pay reparations, revanchism has become stronger and encouraged more and more people to support the idea of reclaiming those lost lands.\nSeveral fascist leaders now issued an ultimatum to us, which demands to dissolve our parliament, resign our posts and let them gain control over the state!\n How do we respond? Submitting would probably stabilize the country, though the fascists would turn our beautiful country into a totalitarian state and hunt down minorities. Rejecting the ultimatum and hunting down fascist sympathizers can either supress their movement or, in the worst case, cause a civil war! This is a diffcult choice only you can make..."
 swp_government.3.a:0 "We're no match against them..."
 swp_government.3.b:0 "Execute their leader and ban their party!"
 #communism coup
 swp_government.4.t:0 "Workers rise up in our cities!"
 swp_government.4.d:0 "Our civilian population suffered terribly in the war and now the reparations we are forced to pay have lead to massive demonstrations and riots. Most people, especially workers, are demanding social security, liberal reforms, anti-corruption measures and a reform of our current political system, which in their view only represents the bourgeois currently.\nThose protesters are a serious issue and we need to handle them carefully. Submitting to their changes will effectively ban us from the country and they may even prosecute us for any potential crimes. Killing their leaders and banning communism altogether could work, but is very risky. If we aren't doing our job well they may organize a revolt and throw the country into chaos!\nWhat should we do?"
 swp_government.4.a:0 "Socialism will prevail, there's nothing we can do!"
 swp_government.4.b:0 "Purge those red bastards!"
 
 #CIVIL WAR!
 #democracy
 swp_government.5.td:0 "Protesters are taking up Arms!"
 swp_government.5.dd:0 "Every minute, the reports are getting worse and worse! Several protesters are now arming themselves and there have been dozens of clashes between them and our police forces throughout the country! Our effort to stop democratic values have failed, several incriminatory documents were somehow discovered and published by the democratic party and even a part of our military has defected to join the rebel's cause!\nThe leaders of the democratic movement encouraged people to form local militias, rise up against our system and occupy important government buildings!\n There's not much we can do now, except hoping for the best and of course crushing this rebellion!"
 swp_government.5.ad:0 "Damn it! Crush the rebels!"
 swp_government.5.bd:0 "(DEFEND DEMOCRACY)"
 #fascists
 swp_government.5.tf:0 "Conflicts with Nationalists have escalated!"
 swp_government.5.df:0 "Even though we tried our best to clean our people from fascist and nationalist thoughts, we failed to take out key figures of the fascist party in your country. They used the opportunity to rally up more people against us, while accusing us of being responsible for every problem there is currently. Now, the situation has escalated as fascist sympathizers clashed with our police forces yesterday. 180 people were killed, several cars were lit and one apartment building even collapsed! Subsequently, the fascists now are accusing us of a "war against the nation" and began to form militias, convince the military to join their side and encourage everyone to kill as many "reactionaries" as possible!\nWe don't have many supporters anymore as most believe the fascist's propaganda by now. Nevertheless, our army hasn't defected yet in large numbers and we may be able to win an armed conflict against our own population.\n This will be a terrible war..."
 swp_government.5.af:0 "We will destroy them!"
 swp_government.5.bf:0 "(SUPPORT THE FASCIST CAUSE)"
 #communism
 swp_government.5.tc:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution!"
 swp_government.5.dc:0 "Terrible news! All over the country, people are rising up to end our regime once and for all! Our assassins and agents failed to take out important leaders of the communist movement and were captured, tortured and executed by them. Our plot has failed and was unfortunately uncovered by the communist party, whose members are now occupying key buildings in our largest cities.\n Additionally, several incriminatory documents became public and thus every minute we lose supporters for our cause!\nThe situation looks grim for us now..."
 swp_government.5.ac:0 "Let's crush these red devils!"
 swp_government.5.bc:0 "(JOIN THE REVOLUTION)"
 ##Civil war averted
 swp_government.6.t:0 "Crisis averted, Rebels arrested and executed!"
 swp_government.6.d:0 "Just a few days ago, several demonstrations demanded huge changes which would have booted us out of the country and transformed it drastically. You decided to decline their demands and started to arrest and execute anyone who was supporting socialist, liberal or nationalist ideas. Several experts in our ranks were convinced that this would eventually lead to a civil war, but luckily most movements are now disorganized and silent!\nWe have to thank you deeply for choosing the correct way! Once more you have proven to be the leader this nation needs to reach properity and fortune!"
 swp_government.6.a:0 "We will prevail!"

 swp_peace_dove:0 "Propose Peace"
 swp_peace_dove_desc:0 "Even though we made a good advance into enemy territory the battles have become a stalemate. Since total occupation is a distant dream under the current circumstances our highest-ranking generals propose to conclude a peace deal with the enemy.

 swp_surrender:0 "Conditional Surrender"

Territorial changes were also comfirmed. In addition to war reparations, [Root.GetName] has agreed to cede every state, which was lost during the war, to [From.From.GetName].\nIt still remains unclear whether the government around [Root.GetLeader] will resign or stay.
